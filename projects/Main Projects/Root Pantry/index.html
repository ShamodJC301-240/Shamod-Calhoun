<!-- AI Upgrade Ideas:
🤖 Learning Progress Tracker:
Use NLP to summarize journal entries and visualize trends in what you’re learning (e.g., "you’ve been focused on circuits this week").
🧩 Component Suggestion Engine:
Train a small model on robotics components data to recommend compatible sensors, microcontrollers, or motors.
🧠 Circuit Fault Predictor (Advanced):
Create a dataset of circuit parameters + failure conditions and train a model to predict faults before they occur.
ML Concepts: NLP summarization, clustering, classification, predictive modeling.-->

🌱 Smart Plant Care Assistant:
Use a model trained on plant datasets to predict watering needs, sunlight hours, or pest risks from user input or uploaded photos.
🍽️ Recipe Recommendation Model:
Build a recommender system that suggests recipes based on what plants the user grows or ingredients they have in their pantry.
📸 Plant Image Classifier:
Train a CNN (like MobileNet or EfficientNet) on plant datasets to identify plants, diseases, or growth stages from pictures.
ML Concepts: computer vision, recommendation systems, data preprocessing.-->
