      <h2>Hello! I'm Shamod</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate developer and creative problem solver dedicated to 
        building engaging web experiences and innovative solutions.
      </p>
      
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how things work on the internet.
        From building my first simple web page to imagining and creating complex applications, I’ve grown into a developer who loves turning ideas into reality.
        Along the way, experimenting with code — and creation in general — has sparked a love for so many other areas of life. That creative curiosity continues to drive me, both in and beyond my work.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond code, I'm someone who's always creating whether that's drawing, working on new concepts, or exploring nature and technology from different angles. I like connecting ideas between worlds: art, design, motion, and logic.
        I might not be “teaching” the community yet, but I am learning with it. My goal is to eventually share what I discover — not as an expert, but as someone who’s growing and building along the way.
